    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked rice (preferably leftover and chilled)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Sesame oil for drizzling (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook Rice: Start by cooking the rice according to package instructions. It's best to use leftover rice that has been chilled as it fries up better.</li>
        <li>Prepare Ingredients: Chop all the vegetables and have them ready for quick stir-frying.</li>
        <li>Heat Oil: Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Scramble Eggs: Pour the beaten eggs into the hot skillet. Stir gently until they are scrambled but still slightly runny. Remove the eggs from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: In the same skillet, add chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until fragrant and the onion is translucent, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Vegetables: Add diced carrot and thawed peas to the skillet. Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Add Rice: Add the cooked rice to the skillet, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Stir-fry the rice with the vegetables until heated through.</li>
        <li>Season: Drizzle soy sauce over the rice. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Finish: Return the scrambled eggs to the skillet. Stir-fry everything together until evenly distributed and heated through.</li>
        <li>Serve: Transfer the fried rice to serving plates. Garnish with chopped green onions and drizzle with sesame oil for extra flavor if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
