    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Taiwan's braised pork rice, known locally as Luroufan (滷肉飯), is a beloved comfort food that epitomizes the essence of Taiwanese cuisine. This savory dish features finely chopped pork belly, slow-cooked in a rich and aromatic sauce made from soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, and a medley of spices including star anise and cinnamon. The braising process allows the pork to absorb the deep flavors of the sauce, resulting in tender, melt-in-your-mouth meat with a glossy finish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g pork belly, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 shallots, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice wine (Shaoxing wine)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
        <li>1 star anise</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>Steamed white rice, for serving</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Pickled vegetables, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Hard-boiled eggs, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Ingredients: Gather all the necessary ingredients listed in the recipe.</li>
        <li>Marinate Pork Belly: In a bowl, combine the finely chopped pork belly with soy sauce, dark soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, and five-spice powder. Mix well to ensure the pork is evenly coated in the marinade. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: In a large pan or wok, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and finely chopped shallots to the pan. Sauté until fragrant and the shallots are translucent, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brown Pork: Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the marinated pork belly to the pan, spreading it out into an even layer. Allow the pork to brown for a few minutes without stirring to develop color and flavor.</li>
        <li>Braise Pork: Once the pork has browned, add the star anise and cinnamon stick to the pan. Pour in the water, enough to almost cover the pork. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and let the pork simmer gently for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the pork is tender and the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Adjust Seasoning: Taste the braised pork and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more soy sauce or sugar according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the braised pork over steamed white rice. Garnish with fresh cilantro, pickled vegetables, and hard-boiled eggs if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Enjoy your homemade Taiwan Luroufan! It's best served hot and pairs well with some pickled vegetables or a side of stir-fried greens.</li>
